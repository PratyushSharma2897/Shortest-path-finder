# Shortest-path-finder
1. Created an interactive 2D maze pathfinding visualizer using Pythonâ€™s curses library to display realtime grid updates in the terminal.
2. Implemented the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from start (O) to
goal (X) in a grid.
3. Rendered the maze with color-coded paths using curses.color_pair() for visual distinction of nodes
and traversal.
4. Utilized queue.Queue() for BFS traversal and time.sleep() to animate step-by-step path
exploration.
5. Built modular functions to find neighbors, track visited cells, and print the maze during the search
process.
6. Strengthened understanding of graph traversal, state management, and real-time UI feedback
within terminal applications.
